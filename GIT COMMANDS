git (--version)
git config --global user.name ""
git config --global user.email ""
git config --list
git init (Intialize empty git repo)
git commit -m ""
git branch (gives the branch name)

Steps:
(1) git status
(2) git add file_name
(3) git commit (permanent tracking)
(4) git log (shows us the entire commit history)
(5) git checkout commit_unique_id (if we want to go back to a previous version or commit we can use that commit id)
(6) git remote add origin <URL> (This command gathers all the committed files from your local repository and uploads them to our repository we created on github.)
(7) git push -u origin master

“Git push” tells git that we want to upload our files and development history from the repository on our local
computer to a repository hosted on github
“-u origin master” means that we want to upload the “master” version of our commits to a repository on github called “origin”

Working with Git Branches
(1) git branch branchname
(2) git checkout branchname (if we want to move from one branch to another)
(3) git merge branchname (git merge branchname to merge branch1 into the master)
(4) git diff master..branch1
(5) git branch -d branchname
